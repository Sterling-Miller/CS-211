# Mini exam HOWTO

Instructions are embedded in file loonweb.py.  

You will write three methods.

- Offerings.select: 
  a method that returns a Course object matching a subject code and number
  if there is a matching course in the Offerings object.
  
- Schedule.free_at: 
  determines whether a student schedule is free (has no class) at a
  a particular time. 
  
- Schedule.together: 
  returns a Schedule object containing the courses that two students
  are both enrolled in (i.e., one belong to both Schedule objects)
 
 
We will test with the test cases in test_loonweb.py as well as some additional test cases.
